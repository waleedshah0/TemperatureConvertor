# TemperatureConvertor
Temperature Convertor using Html, CSS And JavaScript
A simple temperature converter website allows users to convert temperatures from one unit to another. It typically has an input field for the user to enter the temperature in a particular unit (such as Celsius or Fahrenheit), and buttons or radio buttons to select the desired output unit (such as Celsius, Fahrenheit, or Kelvin).
The website is implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Steps to create the project:

Plan the program design and user interface, including the input and output fields and the conversion formula.
Use JavaScript to write the program code.
Create a function or method to perform the temperature conversion, based on the selected input and output scales.
Add error handling to handle invalid input, such as non-numeric values or unsupported temperature scales.
Implement a user interface to display the input and output fields and capture user input, using a graphical user interface (GUI) library or web framework, such as Java Swing, Python or JavaScript React.
Add a button or trigger to initiate the temperature conversion, and display the result in the output field.
Test the program for functionality, usability, and compatibility with different platforms and browsers.
